# Getting started

JOSH is installed very simply through `yarn` or `npm`:

```
npm i @joshdb/core
* OR *
yarn add @joshdb/core
```

## Import
<>
<div innerHTML={md.render(`\`\`\`ts
import { Josh } from "@joshdb/core"; 
/* OR */
const Josh = require("@joshdb/core");
\`\`\``)}></div>
</>
{/* Why like this? Well this uses the same markdown-it styling and prevents installation of external dependencies that just increase bloat */}

## Basic Usage

<>
<div innerHTML={md.render(`\`\`\`ts
const josh = new Josh({ name: "josh" });

const convolutedHelloWorld = async () => {
  await josh.set("hello", "world");
  console.log("hello", await josh.get("hello")); // hello world
};
\`\`\``)}></div>
</>


JOSH itself is written in typescript and builds to `cjs` and `esm` formats, so you can use it in any project.

> We have removed the `umd` builds in order to support `esm` and any usage of Josh in browser will require a bundler such as `webpack` or `rollup`.

### Provider Dependency

However, JOSH cannot function without a [Provider](providers), which provides the communication layer between @joshdb/core and the database you're storing data in. Every provider may have its own specific pre-requisites and sub-dependency, so please take care to read the page for the provider you intend to use.
