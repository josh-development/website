# Getting started

JOSH is installed very simply through `yarn` or `npm`:

```
npm i @joshdb/core
* OR *
yarn add @joshdb/core
```

## Import

<CodeBlock lang='ts' code={initCode} />
{/* Why like this? Well this uses the same markdown-it styling and prevents installation of external dependencies that just increase bloat */}

## Basic Usage

<CodeBlock lang='ts' code={basicUsageCode} />

JOSH itself is written in typescript and builds to `cjs` and `esm` formats, so you can use it in any project.

> We have removed the `umd` builds in order to support `esm` and any usage of Josh in browser will require a bundler such as `webpack` or `rollup`.

### Provider Dependency

However, JOSH cannot function without a [provider](providers), which provides the communication layer between @joshdb/core and the database you're storing data in. Every provider may have its own specific pre-requisites and sub-dependency, so please take care to read the page for the provider you intend to use.

By default Josh will use the [@joshdb/map](/docs/map) provider, which stores data in memory. This is highly fast but not persistent
