# FAQ

## Is JOSH better than [Enmap](https://enmap.evie.dev)?

This depends on your use-case, but generally, yes. Enmap is a great library, but it's not as flexible as JOSH. JOSH has the benefit of more advanced features such as providers and middleware. It's also more performant, and has a lot more features.

## When should I consider migrating away from JOSH?

There's a few indications that maybe you'd want to move away from this system.

Firstly, if you require modelling ("models") or types for your data, as in, very specific limitations on what data can be stored. This is implemented with [schema](/docs/schema) but it's not as advanced as other libraries.

If you find that you're often pulling data from JOSH and manually manipulating it, or if you're making extensive use of the serializer/deserializer feature, maybe it's time to move.

## How do I migrate from Enmap?

It's not a simple process, but it's not too difficult. You'll need to create a new JOSH instance, and then copy the data from Enmap to JOSH. More tools to make this easier are coming in the future

## How do I migrate from Quick.db?

A simple script that loads both `quick.db` and `josh` can be used to migrate data. This is a simple example, but it should give you an idea of how to do it.

```js
const Josh = require('@joshdb/core');
const SQLiteProvider = require('@joshdb/sqlite');
const QuickDB = require('quick.db');

const db = new QuickDB();

const josh = new Josh({
  name: 'josh',
  provider: new SQLiteProvider()
});

async () => {
  const allDocs = await db.all();
  for (const { id, value } of allDocs) {
    await josh.set(id, value);
  }
  console.log('Migrated', allDocs.length, 'documents!');
};
```
