# Providers

## What is a Provider?

A Provider is a layer of communication between JOSH, and a database. Each provider has a payload it can receive from JOSH, where each payload tells it what to do in the database. The provider will then apply the most optimal method to do this in the database, and return the result to JOSH.

## What Providers are available?

At the moment, only a few providers are available, they are as follows:

<ul>
  {(props.providers || []).map(provider => (
    <li> <Link href={`/docs/${provider.name}`}>{provider.name}</Link> </li>
  ))}
</ul>

## Can I add my own Provider?

You sure can! Even though I do my best to create providers for popular storage systems, I can't possibly create all of them. If you have a storage system you'd like to use, by all means you can go about [Creating a Provider](../development/creating-a-provider.md).

> Official providers are always available under the `@joshdb/` scope. Only official providers are supported officially, and are guaranteed functional and safe. Install third-party providers at your own risks!

## How do I use a Provider?

Providers must be installed separately from Josh and are installed as any NPM module is, through either `yarn` or `npm` in the command line. For example, `yarn add @joshdb/sqlite`. Note that each provider may have pre-requisites before installation, check the provider page for details.

To use a provider, simply require it, construct it, and give it to Josh!

For example, again with the sqlite module:

<CodeBlock lang='js' code={sqliteExampleCode} />
