# Using Providers

What is a provider? A provider is simply a layer between [`Josh`](https://github.com/josh-development/core/blob/main/src/lib/structures/Josh.ts) and a database or any other backend you use to store your data.

Each provider receives a payload from every method you use in your instance and returns a modified version of it.

## Getting Started

Providers can be installed separately from Josh using your package manager (e.g. npm).

In the example below we will use the `@joshdb/sqlite` package, which is our in-house SQLite provider.
