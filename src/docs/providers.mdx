# Providers

## What is a Provider?

A Provider is a layer of communication between JOSH, and a database. Each provider has a precise set of instructions it can receive from JOSH, where each instruction tells it what to do in the database.

## What Providers are available?

At the moment, only a few providers are available at all. As time develops, more will be added. Please see the menu on the left to see available providers!

## Can I add my own Provider?

You sure can! Even though I do my best to create providers for popular storage systems, I can't possibly create all of them. If you have a storage system you'd like to use, by all means you can go about [Creating a Provider](../development/creating-a-provider.md).

> Official providers are always available under the `@joshdb/` scope. Only official providers are supported officially, and are guaranteed functional and safe. Install third-party providers at your own risks!

## How do I use a Provider?

Providers must be installed separately from Josh and are installed as any NPM module is, through either `yarn` or `npm` in the command line. For example, `yarn add @joshdb/sqlite`. Note that each provider may have pre-requisites before installation, check the provider page for details.

To use a provider, simply require it, construct it, and give it to Josh!

For example, again with the sqlite module:

<>
<div innerHTML={md.render(`\`\`\`javascript
const Josh = require("@joshdb/core");
const SQLiteProvider = require("@joshdb/sqlite");

const database = new Josh({
  name: "test",
  provider: new SQLiteProvider()
});
\`\`\``)}></div>
